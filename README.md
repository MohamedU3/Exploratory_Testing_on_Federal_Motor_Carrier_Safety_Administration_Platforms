# Project Overview
## Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Platform Testing
This project involved a collaborative effort between QA engineers and front-end developers to enhance the functionality and user experience of multiple websites under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration platform.

## QA Engineer Responsibilities
Testing Scope: Conducted exploratory testing on 15 websites, focusing on user interface and functionality.
Bug Identification: Discovered major and minor bugs for each site, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
Documentation: Registered all findings in a Google Sheet, providing detailed descriptions to aid developer understanding.
Prioritization: Ordered bugs by priority, from most critical to least, to streamline the resolution process.
Grading System: Developed a grading system to evaluate each website from A to F based on aesthetics/UI and functionality.
## Front-End Developer Responsibilities
This was what was assigned for the devs not me.
Assessment Instructions: Reviewed and assessed the front-end development tasks, focusing on aesthetics and functionality.
Development Requirements: Created a hosted web app using React and Material UI, incorporating features like pagination, sorting, and data validation.
Data Visualization: Implemented a table and pivot chart that update in sync, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Testing Methodology
Cross-Platform Testing: Ensured compatibility across different browsers and devices.
Performance Evaluation: Assessed site performance to identify and address bottlenecks.
User Experience: Focused on enhancing the overall user experience through detailed UI assessments.
## Resources
List of Websites: The testing covered the following websites, each linked to its GitHub repository and hosted version for easy access and review.
Feel free to explore the project files and documentation for more detailed insights into the testing and development processes. You will find a pdf file for the front-end assessment, then an excel sheet with the list of all 15 websites and their grades called "Points and Grading" this is the main file that has the final result. As for files like Functionality and UI they just have the test steps I took for each of functional and non-functional testing and these test steps were applied to all websites
